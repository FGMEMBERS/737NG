<!--  Submodels are objects which can be dropped or launched from the user aircraft.
      The trigger is a boolean property, which you define, which when "true" causes
      the submodel to be released/launched. 
      A submodel will create an AIBallistic object which will follow a ballistic path.
      By default one submodel will be released when the corresponding trigger is "true".
      The initial conditions (IC) define the object's starting point (relative to the
      user aircraft's "reported position"), and its initial speed and direction
      (relative to the user aircraft).  If you want to release many similar objects
      with similar IC, then you may use the <repeat>, <delay> and <count> properties
      to define this.  The allowed properties are:

      <name>         The name of the submodel.
      <model>        The path to the visual model.
      <trigger>      The property which will act as the trigger. 
      <speed>        Initial speed, in feet/sec, relative to user aircraft.
      <repeat>       Set "true" if you want multiple releases of this submodel.
      <delay>        Time, in seconds, between repeated releases.
      <count>        Number of submodels available for multiple release.
      <slaved>       Not used yet.
      <x-offset>     Submodel's initial fore/aft position relative to user aircraft.  
                     Fore is positive.
      <y-offset>     Submodel's initial left/right position relative to user aircraft.  
                     Right is positive.
      <z-offset>     Submodel's initial up/down position relative to user aircraft.  
                     Up is positive.
      <yaw-offset>   Submodel's initial azimuth, in degrees, relative to user aircraft's
                     nose.  Right is positive.
      <pitch-offset> Submodel's initial elevation, in degrees, relative to user aircraft's
                     pitch.  Up is positive.
      <eda>          Equivalent Drag Area in ft squared.  The object is assumed to have a 
                     mass of 0.03 slugs and a drag coefficient of 0.295, and sea-level air
                     density is assumed.  Adjust the EDA to give the model the ballistics you need.
                     The default value is 0.007.
      <life>         Life span in seconds.  Default is 900.0.
      <buoyancy>     In ft/sec/sec.  Works opposite acceleration of gravity.  For example, if
                     set to 32 the submodel will feel no gravity. If greater than 32 the object
                     will rise. Default is 0.
      <wind>         Set to true if you want the submodel to react to the wind.  Default is "false".
